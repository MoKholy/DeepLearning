# Lab2: Multinominal Classification

![Multinominal Classification](multinominal_classification.png)

## 1 - Objectives

* Building a model for multinominal classification task.
* Understanding the effect of using CNNs in models.
* Having a look at machine learning interpretability using [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overviews.html).

## 2 - MNIST Dataset

The MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.

You can have a look at [the dataset on the CSV format on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv), you can check the notebooks and ideas applied on it on Kaggle.

Also, the dataset is [builtin in keras](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/) and you can download & load it directly using one code line.

## 3 - Requirements
* In case the submission form contains questions you should answer, **please have a look at the questions first** and prepare the answers while working on the lab; so as not to get stuck while submitting your work.
* Solve [this notebook](lab2.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that **shows the best output found in your experiments**.
* You should deliver a PDF report that has **tables and plots** summarizing all your work and experiments, make sure to indicate any overfitting/underfitting. **The report should also include your observations from the machine learning interpretability part**.
