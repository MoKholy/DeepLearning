# Assignment 4: Music Generation with RNNs

![Music Generation with RNNs](music_generation.jpg)

## 1 - Objectives

* Building Recurrent Neural Network models.
* Working with the next character prediction model.
* Working with few tensorflow parts instead of tf.Keras.

## 2 - Requirements

* Solve [this notebook](lab4.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that shows the best output found in your experiments. **Check the hints in the text cells and commented in the code cells to help guide you while filling in the code**.
* To make sure your work was correct, **there should be at least one generated song at the end with good enough length**. In case no song is generated/all are very short (1~3 seconds for instance), _then their is probably an issue in your work_.
* **The notebook size will be a bit larger due to the generated songs at the end**, make sure you start uploading the notebook some time before the deadline not to miss it and **include the songs in the uploaded notebook**
* No report is required.
